# Solidity Learning Journey

This repository contains a personal collection of beginner-friendly smart contract projects written in Solidity. Each project is created to understand and practice one core concept at a time. The goal is to learn Solidity from the ground up in a clear, practical, and structured way.

## About This Repo

This is a long-term learning project focused on mastering the Solidity programming language through simple, hands-on examples. Each folder represents a specific core concept of Solidity. Inside each folder are two small, carefully written Solidity files that demonstrate the idea in action.

The code is clean, well-commented, and designed for anyone new to programming or blockchain development. All projects are kept as simple and readable as possible for easy learning and future reference.

## Folder Structure

| Folder Name                | Concept Description                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1_syntax_and_semantics    | Understanding how Solidity is written        |
| 2_data_types              | Working with numbers, strings, booleans etc. |
| 3_variables_and_constants | Storing values and using constants           |
| 4_operators               | Performing calculations and logic            |
| 5_functions               | Creating blocks that execute actions         |
| 6_conditionals            | Using if-else logic in contracts             |
| ...                       | More topics will be added as I progress      |

## Projects So Far

### Folder: `1_syntax_and_semantics`

| File Name              | Description                                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MyNameRobot.sol        | A simple contract that stores and returns a name                        |
| FavoriteThing.sol      | A contract that stores a favorite toy or item and returns it publicly   |

Each file includes a clear demonstration of contract structure, variable declaration, and public visibility in Solidity.

## Why This Project Exists

I am learning Solidity from scratch with a focus on truly understanding the core building blocks of smart contracts. This repository helps me track my growth, stay accountable, and share my journey publicly. It also serves as a learning aid for others who may be starting from the same place.

## Learning Approach

- Learn one concept at a time
- Build two small, focused projects under each concept
- Write clean, readable code
- Document everything clearly
- Improve gradually and consistently

## Tools Used

- Remix IDE for writing and testing smart contracts
- GitHub for version control and public documentation

## Next Steps

- Complete data types and variables
- Add logic (operators, conditionals, and functions)
- Move into intermediate and advanced concepts like mappings, events, modifiers, and inheritance

This repo will continue to grow as I learn more about Ethereum development and blockchain programming with Solidity.
